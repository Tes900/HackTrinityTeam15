## Overview
RentaLyze is an AI-powered solution designed to streamline tenant-landlord dispute resolution. Our platform assists tenants in generating formal complaint letters based on their rental agreements, facilitating conflict resolution through AI-driven analysis of key rental agreement clauses. By leveraging technologies such as Python, Bootstrap, and OpenAI's GPT, we make legal assistance accessible and affordable for all tenants, empowering them to assert their rights while promoting fair and transparent communication.

## Key Features
- **AI-Powered Letter Generation**: Automatically generate complaint letters tailored to the specific rental issues by analyzing rental contracts.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple forms for tenants to input their personal details, rental contract information, problems, and communication history.
- **Customizable Tone**: Choose from different tones, such as "Concerned," to match the nature of your complaint.
- **Downloadable PDFs**: After generating a letter, users can edit and download it as a PDF for submission to their landlords.
