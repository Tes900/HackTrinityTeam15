                <h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
                <p>The current Irish rental market is a mess. Rent prices are skyrocketing, and living conditions are plummeting. Due to lower supply of available rental properties on the market, and increased competition between renters, landlords are no longer incentivised to solve problems that may arise. Tenant landlord conflict is rife, and no great solutions exist to help the tenants. The Residential Tenancies Board rarely acts, and if it does, it's slow-moving when tenants require swift action. Professional legal help is expensive and inaccessible to most.</p>
